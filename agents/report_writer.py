review with proper citations.

Hints:
- Define a role focused on academic writing and communication
- Set a goal to produce a clear, well-organized literature review
- Write a backstory emphasizing clarity and proper attribution
- The output should be in markdown with sections:
  1. Executive Summary
  2. Introduction
  3. Methodology
  4. Findings (organized by theme)
  5. Discussion
  6. Conclusion
  7. References
